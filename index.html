								<h4 id="title">Project Overview</h4>
							
								<p>California has the reputation nationally and internationally as a leader in the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels.  With California becoming the most populous state in 1962 combined with ever increasing needs for electricity and personal automobile after World War II, the state started looking to cut down on pollutants.</p>
								<p>One example of California’s leadership in this area was the creation of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in 1967.  It was focused on improving air quality and reducing air pollutants through the regulation of engine emissions.  In fact, in 2024, small gas motors will no longer be legal to sell in the state forcing a change over to electrically powered lawnmowers, lawn and garden equipment, and other things powered by these engines.  The state also gives out one of the largest state incentives for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the Unites States.</p>
								<p>With its ever-increasing population, California has needed to increase energy generation while reducing its carbon footprint.  According to a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), California was second in the US for electrical generation from renewables: first in solar, geothermal, and biomass; fourth in hydroelectric; and sixth in wind.</p>
								<p>The growth is especially noticeable in the South East portion of the state where the desert is particularly well suited for solar production.  Harnessing the power of tectonic plates has led to over 40 geothermal plants north of San Francisco.  Of note should be Kern County which generates more than 50% of the state’s renewable energy with the largest wind and geothermal facilities and the second-largest solar field in the US.</p>

								<h4 id="title">Renewable Energy</h4>
								<p>California uses a wide range of renewable energy resources to meet its clean energy goals, combat climate change, and promote sustainable energy use.</p>
								<h6>Biomass</h6>
								<p>Biomass electricity is drawn from combusting or decomposing organic matter. Biomass plants power homes and businesses with electricity from waste matter that would have been released into the atmosphere, added fuel to forest fires, or burdened landfills.</p>
								<h6>Geothermal Energy</h6>
								<p>Geothermal energy is a source of renewable energy in California. The Geysers, the world’s largest geothermal field, is in Sonoma, Lake, and Mendocino counties. Other major geothermal locations include the Salton Sea area in Imperial County, the Coso Hot Springs area in Inyo County, and the Mammoth Lakes area in Mono County. </p>
								<h6>Hydroelectric Power</h6>
								<p>Hydroelectric power in California is broken down into two categories: large hydro, which are facilities larger than 30 megawatts (MW), and small hydro. Small hydro plants qualify as renewable energy under the Renewables Portfolio Standard. The annual hydropower production in California varies yearly and depends on rainfall.</p>
								<h6>Solar Energy</h6>
								<p>Solar energy in California falls into two categories: solar thermal and solar photovoltaic. The California Energy Commission licenses solar thermal plants above 50 megawatts and promotes solar photovoltaic installation through the Renewables Portfolio Standard, with building efficiency standards, and as a partner in the California Solar Initiative.</p>
								<h6>Wind Energy</h6>
								<p>Wind energy, an integral part of California's electricity portfolio, is needed to help meet the state's Renewables Portfolio Standard, which requires utilities to procure 50 percent of retail sales from renewable sources by 2020 and 60 percent by 2030. Wind projects extend from Imperial County in the south to Shasta County in the north.</p>

								<h4 id="title">Non-Renewable and Nuclear Energy</h4>
							
								<h6>Liquefied Natural Gas</h6>
								<p>California gets about 10 percent of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) from in-state production and 90 percent from five interstate natural gas pipelines. California does not have a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal or any proposed LNG terminals along the coast.</p>
								<h6>Combined Heat and Power</h6>
								<p>Combined heat and power (CHP), or cogeneration, is the simultaneous generation of electrical or mechanical power and useful thermal energy from a single fuel source. CHP systems use thermal energy that would have gone to waste, helping raise the fuel efficiency of the fuel source while reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).</p>
								<h6>Nuclear Energy</h6>
								<p>California has two operating nuclear power reactors at one plant, three nuclear facilities at various stages of decommissioning, and multiple research reactors that are operational or undergoing decommissioning. The California Energy Commission coordinates the activities of state agencies involved with nuclear material shipments.</p>
